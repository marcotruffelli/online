                <h2>E-mail</h2>
                <p>
                    The first electronic mail (email) was a programme called <b>“SNDMSG”</b>. Ray Tomlinson was able to send messages on a computer to other central units. The email address was born as we know it today (localpart@domainpart).
                    Emails became the <b>main telecommunication</b>, exceeding ARPANET.
                    In 1978 was conceived the first “bulletin board system”, where computer science enthusiasts could create forums and they could exchange messages with other users. The access to these virtual communities wasn’t easy, but this problem was overcome with the introduction of modems.

                <p>
                    A small device to connect to a digital world.
                    At the beginning, AT&T held a monopoly over the national telephone system. Before the 1970s, connecting a modem electronically to the telephone system was <b>illegal</b>. The first model to be <b>legalized</b> for commercial use was the <b>"Hayes Smartmodem"</b>.

                <p>
                    The idea for the WELL originated from Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant, aiming to spread the teleconferencing software <b>"PicoSpan"</b> and establish an <b>online community of intellectuals</b>.
                    “Your own your own words”, the guidelines for <b>secure</b> teleconferencing: the WELL was based on the ban of anonymity, ensuring that users took responsibility for their words.

                    Von Meister, in 1987, invented “The Source”, a <b>global</b> network service, which unfortunately failed, but was followed by “CVC”, with Steve Case’s support.
                    When Jim Kimsey joined as CEO, CVC transformed into "Quantum", which later establishing itself in the online service commerce world, rebranding to “America Online”.

                    In 1993, unauthorized Internet access increased dramatically, and this phenomenon was called <b>"Eternal September"</b>.
                    In 1992, thanks to Al Gore, online services were legalized, and the Internet became available to everyone.
